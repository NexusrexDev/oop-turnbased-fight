# oop-turnbased-fight
An attempt to practice some oop concepts.

## About this project
This is a project I had in mind after participating in a Java course, mainly to push myself into some OOP-related stuff.

The game itself is fairly simple, everything is controlled by a single letter. It doesn't last long, with its progression curve (Exp gain and player damage) being easy unless randomness decides to sneak in!

Of course, I'd love to hear any feedback on the coding part, if there's any way to think even cleaner on OOP stuff.

## Software used
- VSCode/IntelliJ IDEA (Coding and building)
- BFXR (Sound effects)
- Famitracker (Music)

## Note
The build couldn't run by clicking the executable (I assume that's due to it being a console application?) but it runs normally in the Command Prompt using the line `java -jar oop-turnbased-fight.jar`
